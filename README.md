# Flappy Bird Evolutionary AI

This is a very simple evolutionary neural network that learned to play a flappy bird clone through a simulation.

Using batches of 100 agents, it simulates games for 20 generations. For each generation, after all the agents have died, it scores them and chooses the best agents to reproduce with minor changes to its network, thus evolving the agents to become better at the game as time goes on
